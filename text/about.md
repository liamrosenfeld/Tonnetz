# About

Hello, I'm Liam Rosenfeld. I will be going into the 11th grade for the 2019-20 school year. This is my submission for the [repl.it](https://repl.it/jam) music competition.

## Motivation

I play Clarinet and Saxophone in the school band. Throughout my dealings with music, I've been fascinated by its underpinnings. This explores a lesser-known corner of music theory called Neo-Riemannian Theory, an alternative to the traditional Roman Numerals.

Because Neo-Riemannian Theory is lesser-known (and also possibly because it has a scary name), it is seldom taught before graduate degrees. I enjoy visualizing abstract concepts through code (as I have [previously done with the Fourier Transform](https://github.com/liamrosenfeld/FourierArtist)) so I saw this as an opportunity to visualize and explain Neo-Riemannian Theory in a way that any musician can learn and explore.

## Usage

This is not meant to be a silver bullet for chord generation. Like all of music theory, this is just a tool. This implementation of the tool is meant to be a vehicle for exploration, and **I hope you have a fun time exploring**.
