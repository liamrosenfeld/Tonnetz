# About

Hello, I'm Liam Rosenfeld. I'll be going into 11th grade for the 2019-20 school year. This is my submission for the repl.it music competition.

## Motivation

I play Clarinet and Saxophone in the school band. Throughout my dealings with music, I've been fascinated by its underpinnings. This explores a lesser known corner of music theory called Neo-Riemannian Theory, an alternative to the traditional Roman Numerals.

I enjoy visualizing abstract concepts through code (as I have [previously done with the Fourier Transform](https://github.com/liamrosenfeld/FourierArtist)) and I saw this as an exciting opportunity to provide an educational and exploratory tool for the Tonnetz and for Neo-Riemannian Theory as whole.

## Usage

This is not meant to be a a silver bullet for chord generation. Like all of music theory, this is just a tool. This implementation of the tool is meant to be a vehicle for exploration, and **I hope you have a fun time exploring**.
