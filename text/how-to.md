# How To Use

The UI is designed to be reasonably self descriptive without being busy, but if you have any questions, you've come to the right place!

## Navigating the Lattice

The lattice can be traversed two ways: keys and buttons. You can either click on the button for the move you want or just click the key next to the move (recommended if you have a physical keyboard).

## Recenter Progression

If the "recenter progression" button is selected the smooth leading tone is reset so all the notes are in their original order (root, third, fifth) instead of the out of order voice leading chord. It's primary purpose is to allow for a complete chord progression to start anywhere on the lattice, not just the center.
