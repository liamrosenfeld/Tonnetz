Some other general info:
This piano has been optimized and only properly tested for linuxsampler.
If you want to optimize the .sfz yourself, values of interest are:
-amp_veltrack (dynamics, %)
-ampeg_release (note release decay, seconds)
-The volume(in dB) on the pedal noise is located on the bottom of the .sfz file under //pedalAction
[!] I suggest you make a backup of the .sfz file before you start fiddling with it :)
In the time of writing, sfz for linuxsampler has not come out of cvs. So, it's still a bit of a pain to get this paino going.
