# Tonnetz

My entry for the REPL.it music hackathon.

This visualizes the Tonnetz (German for Tone-Network). The Tonnetz is a mapping of tonal space and it plays a crucial part in Neo-Riemannian theory. A detailed description of the theory behind the Tonnetz and Neo-Riemannian theory as a whole can be found on the explanations page.

If you want to poke around the code, the original typescript can be found in the 'sketch' folder
