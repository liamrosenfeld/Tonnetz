  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>Hello, I'm Liam Rosenfeld. I'll be going into 11th grade for the 2019-20 school year. This is my submission for the
    repl.it music competition.</p>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>

  <p>I play Clarinet and Saxophone in the school band. Throughout my dealings with music, I've been fascinated by its
    underpinnings. This explores a lesser known corner of music theory called Neo-Riemannian Theory, an alternative to
    the traditional Roman Numerals.</p>

  <p>I enjoy visualizing abstract concepts through code (as I have <a target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/liamrosenfeld/FourierArtist">previously done with the Fourier Transform</a>) and I saw
    this as an exciting opportunity to provide an educational and exploratory tool for the Tonnetz and for
    Neo-Riemannian Theory as whole.</p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>

  <p>This is not meant to be a a silver bullet for chord generation. Like all of music theory, this is just a tool. This
    implementation of the tool is meant to be a vehicle for exploration, and <strong>I hope you have a fun time
      exploring.</strong></p>
